      <h2>How I Ended up Here</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        I live in a relatively small town in central Arizona called Prescott
        Valley. The weather here is great because we get all four seasons, but
        all of them are relatively mild. In the summer, we may have a short
        period of 100&deg; days, but not months of sweltering heat that Phoenix
        sees each year to the south. We get occasional snow in the winter, but
        it is typically gone by the afternoon. To the north in Flagstaff, they
        have much more snow and a colder winter overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the weather is great, the area does have some downsides. The
        disadvantages of the area include the year-round seasonal allergies and
        the reality that this is a major retirement community. Since so much of
        the community is retired, many of the employment opportunities are
        service or medical.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current job is as a Service Supervisor at Kohl's in Prescott Valley.
        It is a decent job with good people. I have learned much about myself
        and grown over the years in my various roles there. When they introduced
        a new education benefit a few years ago, I was excited to see what was
        offered but uncertain how I could best utilize it. I took a leadership
        essentials certificate through eCornell and enjoyed it. It gave me the
        tools to excel in my current role and beyond. After that, I looked at
        something more technology-oriented. I've always been great with
        technology but had little on my resume to demonstrate it. I took the
        Google IT Support Professional Certificate. While working towards that
        certificate, I also dabbled in Python programming through some online
        courses I found. I wanted to see if I enjoyed it and was planning on
        what to learn next. A Python certificate was in my sights.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed building projects with Python far more than IT Support. I
        looked at job postings for Python developers, and they all listed a
        Bachelor's Degree, often as the first requirement. I investigated what
        it would take to earn my Bachelor's through Bellevue and discovered that
        it was not only achievable, but it wouldn't take all that long with my
        transfer credits from my Associate's Degree and certificates.
        <span class="sentence">
          I'm motivated for a change and Software Development feels like the
          best opportunity for my personality and skills.
